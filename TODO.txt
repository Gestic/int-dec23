TODO needed to merge with dev.

FIX:
RemoteMiners - find and fix them working in enemy rooms.

IMPROVE:
RemoteHaulers - improve spawn queue placement. ie. when no haulers exist place in medium queue, when some exist place in low.
RemoteHaulers - improve CARRY needed to haul a source. The calculation of CARRY pieces for distance.
RemoteHaulers - combine spawning remoteHaulers for a room. ie. when two sources exist, it will spawn 2 haulers for source 1 and 2 for source 2. Desired implementation would be to spawn 3 total, since there are some extra CARRY parts on the second hauler for each source.

ADD:
claimers - Task out claimers.
remoteBuilders - Create remoteBuilder task and make them roam through rooms around a spawn repairing roads on swamps, repairing containers to almost max, and building roads on swamps for claimers and remoteHaulers.

IMPLEMENT:
Source Creeper killers - merge and combine features with other branches in repo.
